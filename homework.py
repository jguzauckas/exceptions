# Create a class to represent a person.
# The class should have the following variables:
# - name - str
# - age - int
# - occupation - str
# - hobbies - list[str]
# The class should have the following methods:
# - __init__()
# - __str__()
# - hello() - prints a greeting to that person
# - specific_hobby() - user gives an index, function returns hobby
#   at that index. Check for IndexError!
# - getter and setter methods for name, age, and occupation. Make sure
#   to check for values that are acceptable. Raise a ValueError if they try
#   to set age to a negative number


# Test each of your methods with an instance of a Person

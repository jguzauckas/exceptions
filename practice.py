# Ask the user to enter a number to be squared.
# As a precaution, handle any exceptions that might occur
# when we ask the user to enter something (what if they enter
# something they aren't supposed to?)
# Finally, print out their number squared, if applicable


# Create a dictionary with you and four of your friends as keys,
# and their hair colors as values


# Ask the user to enter a name to find out the hair color from the dict
# As a precaution, handle any exceptions that might occur when
# we try to access a key of a dictionary
# Finally, print out the corresponding hair color if applicable


# Create a function that will take in two inputs: a float and an integer
# This function will raise the numbers to each other 3 times:
# i.e., float ** integer ** float ** integer ** float ** integer
# Handle any exceptions that could occur when this function is called.
# This could be due to numbers too large or the wrong type!


# Test your function by calling values that should cause an exception and
# values that should not.


# Create a division function that takes in two inputs and is prepared
# to handle exceptions based around division.


# Test your function by calling values that should cause an exception and
# values that should not.
